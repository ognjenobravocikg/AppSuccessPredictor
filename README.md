Collaborators: Ognjen Obradovic and Petar Jovic

App Success Predictor, final coursework of Machine Learning class in our University. 
We set out to make a application that takes the Google Playstore dataset and using machine learning, predicts the success of a potential new application. 

The user inputs a couple of things, such as the Id of the developer, category or genra of the app etc. Our algorithm predicts percentage of the possible downloads of the applicaiton.
